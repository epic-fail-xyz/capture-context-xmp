# Capture Context Philosophy

Digital media preserves pixels with extraordinary fidelity, yet the surrounding reality of a moment is often lost.

Capture Context XMP exists to help close that gap.

A photograph is more than an image - it is a record of a physical event occurring at a specific place and time under measurable environmental conditions.

Preserving that context enables future understanding that extends far beyond the original intent of the image.

Possible future uses include:
* scientific research
* climate analysis
* machine learning datasets
* historical archives
* incident reconstruction

The goal is not to predict every use case, but to ensure the data survives intact for uses we cannot yet foresee.

## Core Beliefs
### Context is durable value

Pixels capture appearance. Context captures reality.

### Truth over convenience

Measured observations are favored over derived summaries.

### Longevity over novelty

Schemas should remain interpretable decades into the future.

### Openness enables ecosystems

Metadata vocabularies should be frictionless to adopt.

## Design Posture

Capture Context specifications aim to behave like infrastructure: calm, stable, and dependable.

Rapid expansion is avoided in favor of careful, durable evolution.
